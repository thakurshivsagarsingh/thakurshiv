    <p><b> NEW DELHI – </b> A team of first-year B.Tech CSE students from the National Institute of Technology has clinched the top prize at the annual ‘Code Innovate 2025’ hackathon with their groundbreaking AI-powered tutoring application, 'Synapse'.

The app, developed over a grueling 48-hour coding marathon, uses a sophisticated algorithm to create personalized study plans for engineering students. Synapse can analyze lecture notes, generate practice quizzes based on the curriculum, and even predict topics a student might find challenging, offering extra resources preemptively.

“We noticed many of our classmates struggling to keep up with the fast pace of the engineering curriculum,” said Priya Sharma, one of the app’s creators. “We wanted to build a tool that feels like a personal tutor, available 24/7. Winning was just a bonus.”

Dr. Alok Verma, a judge at the event and a professor of Computer Science, praised the project for its practicality and technical execution. “What Team Synapse accomplished in just 48 hours is remarkable,” he stated. “It’s a polished, market-ready solution to a real-world problem students face every day.”

The team plans to use their prize money to further develop Synapse, with hopes of launching a beta version for their university by the next semester.
